# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for bootcamp students to aid them in working on the Prework. The study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. During the creation process I learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript and how to use them to structure and design an interactive website. I also learned about Git, Github, and Gitbash and their importance as a developer. I plan on more notes added as I learn more about these four topics.
